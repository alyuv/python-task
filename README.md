# Fork this project and send back a pull request.

## What to do
Create a simple API by importing data from GitHub Search API https://developer.github.com/v3/search/

Import repositories that have been written in Python and have `rest` keyword. 

Import just a few fields from GitHub Search API: `full_name`, `html_url`, 
`description`, `stargazers_count`, `language`.

It is necessary to do a script to fill the database.
Add sorting by `stars` to API. 

## Bonus 1
Use docker compose encapsulating all the services related to this app.

## Bonus 2
Add pagination to API.
